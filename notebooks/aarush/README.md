# 2026-02-17 – BOM Work Session
Joint work session to work on PCB, parts, and software evaluation. After a discussion with someone experienced with thin-film force sensors, I briefly evaluated capacitive force sensors before choosing to stick with FSRs for cost purposes. We decided to purchase trial FSRs of different ranges to determine which range yields the most accurate results, since the logarithmic nature of the resistance-force curve yields more accurate results at mid-to-high pressures within the rated range. These are some examples of the ranges available:
